# envy

Hi. Welcome to my nvim config.

This config is my own personal one. It is not meant to be plug-and-play.
Whether it be for an oversight, personal idiosyncracy, or just as an
experiment, a few parts of this config might be weird or confusing. However,
I've documented it as much as I've thought is necessary. Feel free to take
anything from here.

If you have any questions, suggestions, etc. feel free to make an issue. Thanks
for visiting.
