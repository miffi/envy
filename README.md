Hi. Welcome to my nvim config. It's not much, but it's mine.

This config is my own personal one. It is not meant to be plug-and-play.
Whether it be for an oversight, personal idiosyncracy, or just as an
experiment, a few parts of this config might be weird or confusing. However,
I've documented it as much as I've thought is necessary. ~~Well it's still
missing _some_ documentation, I'll get around to that.~~

If you have any questions, suggestions, etc. feel free to make an issue or
reach out to me on discord if you know me there. Thanks for visiting ^^.
